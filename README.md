RAFIKI
======

RAFIKI (Realizing AGN Feedback in Keyframe Images) is an open-source python package developed to analyze
simulated microwave and X-ray data. In its current form, it can be used to generate and stack tSZ images
from raw hdf5 files from SIMBA or any other GIZMO-based code.

Features
--------
        -Create stacked images of Compton-y parameter around galaxies with properties of your choosings
        -Generate radial profiles of the Compton-y parameter and moment analyses of asymmetries
        -Calculate the total thermal energy in an aperature of your choosing and plot against stellar or
        halo mass



Installation
------------

Use
---
At it's base, RAFIKI's functionality is contained in three steps:
        1) Generate maps of tSZ signal from raw hdf5 files
        2) Analyze tSZ maps to extract radial profiles and thermal energy measurements around galaxy
        populations of your choosing
        3) Visualize your data by comparing a range of models and redshifts

Each of these steps is run individually with several user input parameters.
